                    Keybank is quite simple when comparing to FTB, in that i will be taking care of only failed integrations and completed with errors only, when coming to FTB we have to react each and every integrations like document delivery, retrievel document input file , Completed with errors, failed integrations and also taking care of the completed with warnings in FTB.
